A regional endocrinology specialty office is experiencing a decrease in the number of patients seen on a weekly basis. The office consists of four doctors, a nurse practitioner, two registered nurses (RNs), four licensed practical nurses (LPNs), and five administrative staff members. Among the clinic staff, there is some concern that this decrease in volume is due to patient dissatisfaction.

The dataset contains two files with information on 13 weeks of patient complaints.

ComplaintData contains information on 262 customer complaints received over a three-month period. Complaint data is captured through the specialty office website.
